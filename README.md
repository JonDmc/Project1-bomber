# Project1-bomber

In a city that's abundant in scraps and whatnots, you can find 2 Adventurers seeking for materials. An adventurer named Ziggy explored a nearby ruin while her find Bomber was collecting materials. 
Ziggy had slipped and fell in a hole that leads to an abandoned underground city. Little did she know that its not completely abandoned. 
Knowing that Ziggy was missing, Bomber went to the ruins and traverse his way towards the underground city to rescue Ziggy.

With the use of his personal homemade bombs, Help Bomber rescue his friend Ziggy from the hands of the underminers and escape the underground ruins. 
Don't fret, ziggy had unfortunately dropped some of her bombs along the corridors of the ruins. Bomber can pick those up and use it to break the walls of the ruins to save ziggy and defeat the underminers that crosses his way.
